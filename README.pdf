# News Service System – Client/Server Project

## Project Description
This project implements a client–server News Service System using Python, TCP sockets, multithreading, JSON, NewsAPI.org, and file I/O.  
The server retrieves current news headlines and news sources from NewsAPI, saves the raw API responses into JSON files for evaluation purposes, and serves multiple clients simultaneously.  
The client provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to navigate menus, send requests, view lists of results (limited to 15 items), and request full details of a selected item.

## How to Run the System
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.  
2. Run the server:
   python server.py  
3. Open another terminal.  
4. Run the client:
   python client_gui.py  
5. Enter a username and click Connect.

## The Scripts
server.py:
- Starts a TCP server and listens for incoming client connections  
- Handles multiple clients using multithreading  
- Retrieves data from NewsAPI  
- Saves API responses into JSON files  
- Sends lists and detailed information to clients  
- Logs client connections and disconnections  

client_gui.py:
- Provides a graphical user interface using Tkinter  
- Connects to the server and sends the client username  
- Displays menus and validates user input  
- Receives and displays server responses  

## Additional Concept
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The client application uses Tkinter to provide a graphical interface instead of a command-line interface.  
This improves usability and user interaction.

## Acknowledgments
- NewsAPI.org for providing the news data API  
- Python official documentation for sockets, threading, JSON, and Tkinter  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete client–server architecture that retrieves live news data from an external API, supports multiple concurrent clients, stores responses in JSON files, and provides a user-friendly graphical interface.
